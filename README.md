## CONCLUSTION AND RECOMMENDATION: 
- The primary factor contributing to Nigeria's subpar performance may stem from being the only African country (excluding Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Tanzania) where an overall percentage discount exceeding 80% was granted to customers who made purchases in 2014.
-	The overall shipping costs for delivering products to Nigeria are notably on the higher side.
-	Indonesia emerges as the least performing country in South Asia when considering the total profit from the sales of tables. It may be important for the Global Super Store to contemplate discontinuing the sales of tables in Indonesia.
